## Getting Started

Deploy Craftplan on your own server. No need to clone the repo:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puemos/craftplan/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puemos/craftplan/main/.env.example
cp .env.example .env   # Fill in the required secrets (see .env.example)
docker compose up -d
```

This starts Craftplan, PostgreSQL, and MinIO with migrations running automatically.

See the [self-hosting guide](https://puemos.github.io/craftplan/docs/self-hosting/) for single-container mode, Railway deployment, reverse proxy setup, and more.

## Development Setup

> For contributors who want to work on the codebase. **Prerequisites:** Docker, Elixir ~> 1.15, Erlang/OTP 27

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d   # Start PostgreSQL + MinIO + Mailpit
mix setup               # Install deps, migrate, build assets, seed
mix phx.server          # Start at localhost:4000
```

See the [development setup guide](https://puemos.github.io/craftplan/docs/getting-started/) for detailed instructions.

## Why Craftplan?

- **Purpose-built for artisanal manufacturing** — not a generic ERP adapted to fit; workflows are designed around small-batch, made-to-order production
- **Allergen & nutritional tracking** — first-class support for food and beverage producers who need to track ingredients and generate nutrition labels
- **BOM versioning with cost rollups** — iterate on recipes and formulas while keeping full history and accurate costing
- **Self-hosted, no vendor lock-in** — your data stays on your infrastructure, backed by PostgreSQL
