# Settings

The Settings area at **Manage → Settings** controls global configuration for your Craftplan instance.

## General Settings

![General Settings](/craftplan/screenshots/settings.webp)

* **Hourly rate** — Default labor rate used in BOM labor step calculations. Individual steps can override this value.
* **Overhead percentage** — Applied on top of labor costs during BOM rollup calculations.
* **Default currency** — Sets the currency for all monetary values (prices, costs, invoices).

## Markup Configuration

Configure how suggested retail and wholesale prices are calculated from BOM unit costs:

* **Mode** — Choose between `percent` (percentage markup) or `fixed` (flat amount added to cost)
* **Retail markup** — Value applied for retail price suggestions
* **Wholesale markup** — Value applied for wholesale price suggestions

These feed the **Suggested Prices** card on the product details tab.

## Allergens

Manage the list of allergens available for tagging materials. These propagate through BOMs to products automatically.

## Nutritional Facts

Configure which nutritional fact fields are tracked (calories, protein, fat, carbohydrates, etc.). Values defined on materials are auto-calculated for products based on BOM component quantities.

## Calendar Feed

Subscribe to your Craftplan schedule in Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or any app that supports iCal feeds. Navigate to **Settings → Calendar Feed** to manage subscriptions.

* **Generate Calendar Feed** — Creates a new API key with read-only access to orders, customers, and production batches, and displays a subscription URL. Copy the URL immediately; the full key is only shown once.
* **Feed list** — All active calendar feeds are listed with their name, masked URL, creation date, and last-used timestamp.
* **Revoke** — Disable a feed at any time. Any calendar app using that URL will stop receiving updates.

### How to subscribe

**Google Calendar:** Open Settings → Other calendars → **+** → **From URL**, paste the feed URL.

**Apple Calendar:** Go to **File → New Calendar Subscription**, paste the URL.

### What’s included

The feed covers a rolling window: 30 days in the past through 90 days in the future. Events include:

* **Order deliveries** — Summary shows the order reference and customer name
* **Production batches** — Summary shows the batch code and product name

The feed endpoint is at `/api/calendar/feed.ics?key=<your-key>`. Calendar apps refresh automatically on their own schedule.

## CSV Import & Export

Settings provides bulk data operations:

![Import Export](/craftplan/screenshots/import-export.webp)

* **Export orders** — Download order data as CSV
* **Export customers** — Download customer records as CSV
* **Export inventory movements** — Download stock movement history as CSV

These exports are useful for external reporting, accounting integration, or data backup.

## Email Configuration

### Sender Identity

Configure who outgoing emails appear to come from:

* **Sender name** — Display name shown in email clients (default: “Craftplan”)
* **Sender address** — From address on outgoing emails (default: “[noreply@craftplan.app](mailto:noreply@craftplan.app)”)

These settings apply to all transactional emails sent by Craftplan (order confirmations, password resets, etc.).

### Email Provider

Craftplan supports multiple email delivery providers. Select a provider from the **Provider** dropdown in Settings and fill in the required credentials. Once saved, the new provider is active immediately, no restart required.

| Provider | Required Fields |
| --- | --- |
| **SMTP** | Host, port, username, password, TLS mode |
| **SendGrid** | API key |
| **Postmark** | API key |
| **Brevo** (Sendinblue) | API key |
| **Mailgun** | API key, sending domain |
| **Amazon SES** | Access key, secret key, AWS region |

API keys and secrets are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM via the [Cloak](https://hex.pm/packages/cloak_ecto) library.

#### SMTP

The default provider. Configure your own mail server or a third-party SMTP relay:

* **SMTP host** — Hostname of your mail server (e.g. `smtp.mailgun.org`)
* **SMTP port** — Server port (default: 587)
* **Username** — SMTP authentication username
* **Password** — SMTP authentication password
* **TLS** — Transport security mode: `if_available` (default), `always`, or `never`

When credentials (username and password) are left blank, Craftplan connects without authentication.

#### SendGrid / Postmark / Brevo

These providers require a single **API key** obtained from their respective dashboards.

#### Mailgun

Requires an **API key** and the **sending domain** you have verified with Mailgun (e.g. `mg.example.com`).

#### Amazon SES

Requires an IAM **access key**, **secret key**, and the **AWS region** where SES is configured. Available regions include `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`, `eu-west-1`, `eu-central-1`, `ap-south-1`, and `ap-southeast-2`.

### Environment Variable Fallback

You can also configure the email provider via environment variables at deploy time. Database settings always take priority.

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `EMAIL_PROVIDER` | Provider name: `sendgrid`, `postmark`, `brevo`, `mailgun`, or `amazon_ses` |
| `EMAIL_API_KEY` | API key (or SES access key) |
| `EMAIL_API_SECRET` | SES secret key (Amazon SES only) |
| `EMAIL_API_DOMAIN` | Sending domain (Mailgun only) |
| `EMAIL_API_REGION` | AWS region (Amazon SES only, default: `us-east-1`) |

For backward compatibility, if `EMAIL_PROVIDER` is not set but `SMTP_HOST` is present, Craftplan uses the SMTP adapter with the legacy variables:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `SMTP_HOST` | Mail server hostname |
| `SMTP_PORT` | Mail server port (default: 587) |
| `SMTP_USERNAME` | Auth username |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | Auth password |

### Encryption Key

In production, a `CLOAK_KEY` environment variable is required to encrypt and decrypt API keys stored in the database. Generate one with:

```
openssl rand -base64 32
```
