# Development Setup

> **Looking to run Craftplan?** See the [Self-Hosting guide](/craftplan/docs/self-hosting/). This page is for developers who want to contribute.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Craftplan, make sure you have the following installed:

* **Elixir** 1.18 or later
* **Erlang/OTP** 25 or later
* **PostgreSQL** 16 or later
* **Node.js** 18 or later (for asset building)
* **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (recommended for running PostgreSQL and MinIO)

## Starting Dependencies

The easiest way to run PostgreSQL and MinIO (S3-compatible object storage) is with Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts PostgreSQL 16 on the default port and MinIO for file storage.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/puemos/craftplan.git
   cd craftplan
   ```
2. Run the full setup (installs deps, runs migrations, builds assets, seeds data):

   ```
   mix setup
   ```

   This single command handles `mix deps.get`, `mix ash.setup`, asset installation, and database seeding.
3. Start the Phoenix development server:

   ```
   mix phx.server
   ```
4. Open [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser.

## Common Commands

| `mix phx.server` | Start the dev server |
| `mix test` | Run the test suite |
| `mix test path/to/test.exs` | Run a single test file |
| `mix test path/to/test.exs:42` | Run a specific test at a line |
