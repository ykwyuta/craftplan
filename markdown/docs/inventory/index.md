# Inventory

The Inventory module tracks raw materials from receiving through consumption, with full lot traceability and demand forecasting.

## Materials

Navigate to **Manage → Inventory → Materials** to see all raw materials. Each material record includes:

* Name, SKU, and unit of measure
* Buy price (used for BOM cost calculations)
* Minimum and maximum stock levels for reorder alerts
* Allergen flags (auto-aggregated into products via BOMs)
* Nutritional facts per unit (auto-calculated into product nutrition via BOMs)

## Lots

Materials are organized into lots for traceability. Each lot tracks:

* Quantity on hand
* Supplier and purchase order reference
* Expiry date
* Receiving date

When consuming materials during production, stock is deducted from lots based on availability.

## Stock Movements

Every change to inventory is recorded as a movement with a type:

* **Receive** — Stock added from a purchase order or manual adjustment
* **Consume** — Stock deducted during production batch completion
* **Adjust** — Manual corrections (e.g., spoilage, stocktake differences)

The movement history provides a full audit trail for each material.

## Allergens & Nutritional Facts

* Materials can be tagged with allergens (e.g., gluten, dairy, nuts). These propagate up through BOMs so that products automatically show aggregated allergen information.
* Nutritional facts (calories, protein, fat, carbs, etc.) are defined per material unit. When a BOM references the material, the product’s nutritional facts are calculated from the component quantities.

## Forecasting & Reorder Planning

The inventory forecasting module (`Craftplan.InventoryForecasting`) predicts material demand based on upcoming orders:

* Looks at confirmed orders and their delivery dates
* Calculates required material quantities from product BOMs
* Compares demand against current stock levels
* Highlights shortages so you can create purchase orders before running out

The **Materials** tab on the planner also surfaces shortage warnings for the selected time horizon.
