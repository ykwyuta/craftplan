# Orders

The Orders module manages the full lifecycle of customer orders from creation through delivery.

## Creating Orders

Navigate to **Manage → Orders** to see all orders. Create a new order by:

1. Selecting a customer
2. Setting a delivery date
3. Adding order items (products with quantities)

Each order gets a unique reference number for tracking.

## Order Items & Statuses

Order items track individual products within an order. Each item progresses through statuses:

* **Pending** — Item created, not yet scheduled
* **Scheduled** — Assigned to a production date
* **Completed** — Production finished via batch completion (material consumption and cost snapshot triggered)
* **Delivered** — Item shipped to customer

Items are allocated to production batches from the planner’s day-view kanban board. When a batch is completed, its allocated order items receive a cost snapshot with material, labor, and overhead costs.

## Calendar View

The order calendar provides a visual timeline of upcoming deliveries. Use it to:

![Orders Calendar](/craftplan/screenshots/orders.webp)

* See delivery commitments by day and week
* Identify capacity conflicts
* Drag items between dates for rescheduling

The calendar integrates with the planner’s schedule tab for production planning.

## Invoicing

Orders can generate invoices that include:

* Line items with quantities and prices
* Cost data pulled from BOM rollups at completion time
* Customer billing and shipping addresses

## CSV Export

Orders can be exported to CSV from **Manage → Settings**. The export includes order details, item breakdowns, statuses, and delivery dates for use in external tools or reporting.
