# Catalog & BOMs

The Catalog area centralizes product setup, cost rollups, and pricing guidance. All recipe functionality is built on Bills of Materials (BOMs) with simple versioning.

## Navigating to the Editor

1. Go to **Manage → Catalog → Products**.
2. Select any product. The **Details** tab shows pricing guidance; the **Recipe** tab opens the BOM editor.

## BOM Versioning

Craftplan uses a simple versioning model:

* The header shows the current `vN` with a “Latest” chip. Older versions display a gold banner with a **Go to latest** shortcut and switch all inputs to read-only.
* **Show version history** opens a modal listing each version, its status, published timestamp, and unit cost from the cached rollup. Use **View** to jump to a specific version.
* Saving always creates a new active BOM (with `published_at` set to now) and archives the previous active version automatically.
* The editor supports `?v=NUMBER` in the URL for deep-linking to a specific historical version.

## Materials, Sub-assemblies & Totals

* Each row in the materials grid links back to the inventory SKU and shows per-row totals using the material’s buy price.
* **Add Material** picks from stocked materials. **Add Sub-assembly** pulls another product’s BOM into the current one. Items already added are hidden from the picker to prevent duplicates.
* The table header displays running totals (`Total Cost`) so you always see the material spend per product run.

## Labor Steps & Scaling

* The **Labor steps** card shows the configured hourly rate and overhead from **Manage → Settings → General** with a direct “Update in settings” link.
* Each step captures a name, duration (minutes), `units_per_run`, and an optional rate override.
  + `units_per_run` defaults to 1. If a mixing step produces four trays at once, set it to 4 so minutes are divided by four when calculating per-unit cost.
  + Rate overrides accept decimals for differentiating specialized labor (e.g., decorate vs. prep).
  + Steps cannot be blank and `units_per_run` must be at least 1.
* The right column shows per-unit labor cost per step. The header displays accumulated minutes and the per-unit total. Overhead percentages are applied later via the rollup.

## Notes & Saving

* Process notes live in the “General notes” textarea beneath the labor grid, persisted alongside the BOM version.
* The **Save Recipe** button is only available on the latest version and disables itself unless there are changes and the form is valid.

## Pricing Guidance & Cost Rollups

* The **Details** tab includes a **Suggested Prices** card with retail and wholesale recommendations. These use the current BOM unit cost and the markup mode/value pairs configured in settings (percent or fixed).

* Materials, labor, and overhead costs are persisted in `catalog_bom_rollups`. The planner, invoices, and insights features read from the rollup, so keeping BOMs current is important.
* Batch completions copy the BOM costs onto each finished order item. These power the **Completion Snapshot** in the planner and future COGS reports.
