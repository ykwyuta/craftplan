# Overview & Planner

The planner lives at **Manage → Overview** (`/manage/overview`). It is the first page you see after signing in and keeps the plan-make-stock loop in one place.

## Global Search (Command Palette)

Press `Cmd+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) anywhere in Craftplan to open the command palette. It provides instant fuzzy search across all your data:

* **Products** — Jump to any product by name or SKU
* **Materials** — Find raw materials and ingredients
* **Orders** — Search orders by reference or date
* **Customers** — Look up customers by name
* **Production Batches** — Locate batches by code

Use arrow keys to navigate results and Enter to select. Press Escape to close.

## Layout & Tabs

The planner is organized into four sections:

* **Overview** (default) — Summarizes today’s orders, outstanding quantities, over-capacity details, and upcoming material shortages.
* **Schedule** — Day and week views with a kanban board for batch management. The day view defaults on mount.
* **Make Sheet** — Printable run sheet with a fullscreen dialog. Print via the “Print” button or `Cmd+P` / `Ctrl+P`.
* **Materials** — Rolls up per-material demand, current stock, and shortage warnings for the selected horizon.

The entire surface is LiveView-driven, so switching views or navigating dates keeps state without extra page loads.

## Schedule: Day View (Kanban Board)

The day view (`/manage/production/schedule?view=day`) is the primary workspace for managing production. It presents a four-column kanban board:

1. **Unbatched** — Order items scheduled for the day that have not been assigned to a batch yet. Cards are grouped by product and show total quantity and order count.
2. **Open** — Batches that have been created but not started.
3. **In Progress** — Batches currently being produced.
4. **Done** — Completed batches with consumed materials and cost snapshots.

### Working with the Kanban Board

* **Drag and drop** cards between columns to advance batch status. The board enforces valid transitions (e.g., you cannot skip from Open to Done).
* **Click a card** to open its detail modal showing allocated orders, quantities, and action buttons.
* Use the **Prev / Today / Next** controls to navigate between days.

### Creating Batches

Click an unbatched card to open its modal, then press **Batch All** to create a new production batch. This:

* Groups all unbatched order items for that product on the selected day
* Calculates remaining unplanned quantity per item (avoids double-allocation)
* Snapshots the active BOM version and components map
* Auto-generates a unique batch code

### Progressing Batches

From the batch detail modal:

* **Start** — Moves the batch from Open to In Progress and records `started_at`.
* **Mark Done** — Opens an inline completion form with fields for produced quantity and optional duration in minutes. Submitting triggers auto-FIFO material consumption and cost snapshot capture.

## Schedule: Week View

The week view (`/manage/production/schedule?view=week`) shows a seven-day calendar grid. Each cell displays product cards with quantity summaries and batch status badges. Clicking a card navigates to the day view for that date.

Cards in both views show capacity warnings when a product exceeds its `max_daily_quantity`.

## Overview Dashboard

The overview tab (`/manage/overview`) displays:

* **Orders today** — Deliveries scheduled for the current date with reference, customer, and total.
* **Outstanding today** — Products with remaining todo and in-progress quantities.
* **Over-capacity details** — Products exceeding their daily production limit.
* **Days over order capacity** — Days where confirmed orders exceed the global daily cap.
* **Upcoming material shortages** — Materials where projected end-of-day balance goes negative.

## Printing & Quick Actions

* The **Make Sheet** dialog shows the entire day’s run in a printable table grouped by product, with total and completed quantities.
* The **Materials** tab mirrors shortage data so you can confirm stock before starting a run.

## Tips

* The day view is the default on mount — bookmark `/manage/production/schedule` for one-click access to today’s board.
* Week view cards link to the day view on click, so you can quickly drill into a specific day.
* Batch detail modals link to the full batch page (`/manage/production/batches/:batch_code`) for deeper inspection.
* Order reference badges in modals link back to the order detail page for customer follow-ups.
